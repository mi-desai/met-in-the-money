                In April 2016, the <span class="emphasis">Metroplitan Museum of Art</span> announced it was scaling back spending significantly after revealing a persistent <span class="emphasis">$10 million operating deficit</span>. Combined with lower
                admissions revenues despite a record number of visitors, an expensive plan to acquire the <span class="emphasis">Breuer</span> building from the Whitney, and a (now abandoned) scheme to renovate the "Lila Acheson Wallace" wing, and add
                a new modern art wing with a total price tag of $700 million, the fiscal situation was becoming strained. The museum's board and trustees implemented a plan to restructure the museum by <span class="emphasis">letting go of dozens of employees</span>,
                and to lobby the city of New York to start charging <span class="emphasis">mandatory admissions fees</span> to out-of-towners. The new CEO, Dan Weiss, promised the operating budget would be balanced by the end of <span class="emphasis">fiscal year end 2020.</span>                So the question is, have these efforts been successful? And how will it impact the average New Yorker or tourist?

                                    <li>Ordinarily, operating deficits among nonprofits are <span class="emphasis">much more common</span> than in for-profits.</li><br>
                                    <li>Because so much revenue comes from endowment support and gifts, donors and trustees were unwilling to increase their commitments, so the Met was <span class="emphasis">forced</span> to cut its budget.</li><br>
                                    <li>But, the Met was between <span class="emphasis">a rock and a hard place:</span> it cannot operate without continual support from donors, but it also can't just start charging visitors for tickets - <span class="emphasis">or can it?</span></li><br>

                                    <li>The largest reduction has been in <span class="emphasis">Administrative Expenses</span>, where almost $10 million has been saved from the yearly budget.</li><br>

                                    <li>The addition of the building and personnel expenses related to the operations of the <span class="emphasis">Met Breuer</span> drove most of the cost increases since 2015. </li>

                                    <li>According to the CFO, <span class="emphasis">70% of all costs</span> regardless of category relate to employees.</li><br>
                                    <li>Apart from salaries, costs can be driven by <span class="emphasis">pensions</span>, particularly defined-benefit pension obligation plans.</li><br>
                                    <li>Lastly, many of the Met's workers are organized into unions, which allows for <span class="emphasis">collective bargaining</span> and makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to cut wages.</li><br>
                                    <li>So, <span class="emphasis">costs can't really be cut too much</span>, which is makes sense, given that only 34 people were let go during the restructuring.

                                    <li><span class="emphasis">Gifts and donations generated from fundraising</span> is probably the most important source of cash for the Met.</li>
