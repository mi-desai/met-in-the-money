Persistently negative operating margins means the Met has to consistently either borrow money via debt or withdraw larger-than-projected amounts from its endowment. Over the long term, the endowment has to generate
                    either a higher positive return on its investment portfolio to keep up with the shortfall in the budget, or additional funds have to be raised from trustees or donations. While expenses higher than revenues is much more normal for
                    non-profits, it is the persistence of the deficit that is concerning for the future of the Met, rather than its existence in the first place.
